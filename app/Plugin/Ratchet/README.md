CakePHP plugin wrapping Ratchet

## What is Ratchet ##

Ratchet for CakePHP brings [the Ratchet websocket](http://socketo.me/) package to CakePHP. Websockets allow you to utilize near-real-time communication between your application and it's visitors. For example notifying a page the associated record in the database has been updated using the [Pushable behaviour](http://wyrihaximus.net/projects/cakephp/ratchet/documentation/model-push.html).

## Getting started ##

Keep in mind that this should only be used to push data around. Handling and processing that data is the applications job this plugin is only to get it from and to the client.

#### 0. Requirements ####

* PHP 5.4+
* CakePHP 2.x
* Composer
* SSH/Shell access
* ext-libevent is highly reccomended

#### 1. Installation ####

Installation is easy with [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) just add Ratchet to your composer.json. ([Read more here on Composer and CakePHP 2.x.](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/installation/advanced-installation.html#installing-cakephp-with-composer))

```
composer require wyrihaximus/ratchet 
```

Composer makes sure [Ratchet](https://github.com/cboden/Ratchet), yes I named this plugin after the underlying library, and other components are pulled in.

#### 2. Setup the plugin ####

Make sure you load `Ratchet` with the `bootstrap` option set to true:
```php
CakePlugin::load('Ratchet', ['bootstrap' => true]);
```

#### 3. Using the helper ####

Add the helper to the `AppController` or to specific controllers that will use it.

```php
$helpers = [
  'Ratchet.Wamp',
];
```

Then in your view or layout template add this:

```php
<?php $this->Wamp->init(); ?>
```

#### 4. Start and stopping the server ####

The server can be started with the following command, from your `app` directory (the verbose flag gives you debug information to see what is going on internally):

```bash
./Console/cake Ratchet.websocket start --verbose
```

If you've configurated the queue correctly you can stop the server with the following command:

```bash
./Console/cake Ratchet.websocket stop
```

For a proper way to boot the server check out the [Ratchet example supervisor configuration](http://socketo.me/docs/deploy#supervisor).
